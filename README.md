#Architecture and Design
The application is designed as a web-based Countries Explorer with integrated weather information for each country. The architecture is primarily client-server and follows component-based design. Here's a breakdown of the key design choices:

1. Client-Side (Frontend)
ReactJS: The frontend is built using ReactJS, which allows for a highly interactive and dynamic user interface. React's component-based architecture makes it easy to maintain and scale as new features (such as additional country information, weather forecasts, or filters) are added in the future.

Apollo Client with GraphQL: Apollo Client is used to interact with the GraphQL API (https://countries.trevorblades.com/) to fetch country data. GraphQL was chosen for its flexibility in querying only the required data, reducing the payload size and improving performance. The Apollo Client provides a structured way to handle caching, fetching, and managing API calls.

Axios for Weather Data: Axios is used to make HTTP requests for weather data from the OpenWeather API. Axios simplifies handling requests, and its automatic handling of JSON responses ensures smooth integration of weather data.

State Management (useState, useEffect): React’s built-in hooks such as useState and useEffect are used for managing state and side effects (e.g., fetching data, handling user interactions). This allows the app to respond to user actions such as searching for a country or filtering by region.

2. Server-Side (Backend)
Third-Party APIs: The backend is composed of two primary data sources:
GraphQL API for country information (name, region, population, languages, etc.)
OpenWeather API for weather-related data such as temperature, humidity, and forecasts.
The backend is not self-hosted, as all the data is fetched from third-party services. The app acts as a frontend that communicates with these external services, processes the data, and presents it to the user.

3. Data Flow
The data flow starts with the user interacting with the frontend:

Search and Filter: Users input a country name or select a region to filter countries. This triggers a request to the GraphQL API to fetch relevant country data.
Weather Data Fetch: Once a country is selected, the app fetches weather data for that country using the OpenWeather API. The weather information is then displayed along with the country details.
State Management: State management is handled by React’s useState and useEffect to store and update the country list and weather data.

#Benefits of This Architecture to Stakeholders

Scalability: The use of React and GraphQL ensures the app can easily scale by adding new features or APIs without significant refactoring. For instance, adding more filters or data from additional APIs can be done seamlessly.

Maintainability: The separation of concerns, with distinct components handling different features (search, filters, details, etc.), ensures the codebase is modular and maintainable.

Performance: GraphQL’s ability to fetch only the required data leads to optimized network performance, especially for mobile users or users with slower connections.

User Experience: The use of MUI ensures the app is responsive, intuitive, and aesthetically pleasing. This is crucial for a wide user base, including those with varying levels of technical expertise.

Cost-Effective: By using third-party APIs, the application avoids the need for developing a backend, which reduces infrastructure costs and maintenance overhead.

Challenges Faced
1. Integrating Multiple APIs
One of the biggest challenges was integrating and synchronizing data from different sources, such as the GraphQL API for country information and the OpenWeather API for weather data. Ensuring that the data from both sources was available and correctly linked (e.g., matching country names with weather data) was crucial.

Solution: I handled this by ensuring that both APIs were queried separately and their data merged on the frontend based on common attributes like country name or code.

2. Managing State
Managing the state across multiple components, especially when dealing with asynchronous API calls, was a challenge. Ensuring that data from the search query, filters, and weather data updates seamlessly without causing unnecessary re-renders or API calls was tricky.

Solution: I used React’s built-in hooks like useState and useEffect to manage state. Additionally, I employed debouncing for search input to avoid firing too many API requests while the user is typing.

3. Handling API Rate Limits
Both the GraphQL API and OpenWeather API impose rate limits, which means excessive API calls could result in errors or blocked requests. This was especially important when users repeatedly searched or filtered countries.

Solution: To mitigate this, I added error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle API rate limits and notify users when the request limit is reached. I also implemented debouncing in the search input field to limit the frequency of requests.

4. Styling and Responsiveness
Designing the UI to be fully responsive across all devices was a challenge. Ensuring that all elements adapt well to different screen sizes, especially when displaying country details or weather information, required careful consideration.

Solution: I used Material-UI components, which are designed to be responsive by default. I further tested the UI on multiple screen sizes and adjusted the layout as necessary.

#Regrets and Next Steps

Regrets
Limited Error Handling: Although I implemented basic error handling, it could be further improved, especially in cases of network failures or when APIs return incomplete data. A more comprehensive system to track errors would improve user experience.

No Caching: The app makes repeated API calls every time a user searches for a country or updates the filters. Implementing caching mechanisms (e.g., using localStorage or Apollo Client cache) could improve performance and reduce redundant API calls.

Next Steps
Improve UI/UX: I would add more interactivity, such as showing country flags, providing a detailed view of weather forecasts, and supporting user preferences (e.g., allowing users to save favorite countries).

Introduce Pagination or Lazy Loading: For better performance, especially when dealing with large datasets, implementing pagination or lazy loading for country lists would enhance the user experience.

Enhance Search Functionality: I would expand the search functionality to allow users to search by multiple criteria (e.g., population, region, language) and refine the search results based on these filters.

Deploy the App: I would deploy the app to a hosting platform like Vercel or Netlify to make it publicly accessible.

By addressing these next steps, I would continue to refine the app to meet the needs of a broader audience and provide more robust features.
